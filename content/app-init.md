When using Mailchain for the first time you need to initialize the application.

> **ATTENTION**: Ensure that you have setup the [prerequisites](/app-prerequisites) to run Mailchain.

Simply run:

```sh
mailchain init
```

Follow the instructions inserting the settings from the prerequisites. If you made a mistake, will need to remove the .mailchain.yaml file. You can simple run `mailchain init` again and it will give you the option to remove the current file and start over.
