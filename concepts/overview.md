# Overview

The majority of blockchain protocols provide no standard way to handle messaging. Some account holders have sent messages as an encrypted or unencrypted string included in transaction data. Some applications work around the problem by asking users to link another method of contact \(e.g. email address, phone number etc.\) to an application. This compromises anonymity by asking users to link or reveal an identity. It also increases exposure to security risks, and relies on additional centralized services.

Mailchain gives users the ability to [send](send.md), [receive](receive.md), and [read](read.md) rich-media HTML messages between public addresses through a simple, email-like interface. All message contents and attachments are encrypted so only the intended recipient of the message can decrypt and view messages.

### Protocols

Mailchain is a simple, secure and practical standard which can be implemented across different blockchain protocols. It uses underlying native blockchain protocol foundational capabilities including addressing, transaction history, data transmission, and cryptography.
